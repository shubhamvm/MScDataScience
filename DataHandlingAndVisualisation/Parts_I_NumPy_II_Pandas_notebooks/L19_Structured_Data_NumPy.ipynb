    "The [Collatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating certain simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. In other words,\n",

    "This conjecture is extraordinarily difficult, and is believed to be completely out of reach of present day mathematics. As of 2020, it has been verified by computer for all starting values up to $2^{68} \\approx 2.95\\times10^{20}$.\n",
