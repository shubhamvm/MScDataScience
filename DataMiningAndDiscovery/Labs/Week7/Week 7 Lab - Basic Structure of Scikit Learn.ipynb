    "Now that we have finished the preprocessing part of the course, we can begin the discussion of how to extract meaningful and insightful patterns within datasets. Recall, by this point we should be able to load a dataset, explore its summary statistics and basic properties through visualisation, and clean up the data by removing/replacing missing values, combining data sets, handling noise etc. With all this done, the purpose of this lab sheet is to briefly discuss the general approach to applying machine learning algorithms to the chosen dataset. In a separate lab sheet we will actually start extracting patterns by means of linear regression."

    "- __Step 1__ Import the model: In general, this takes the form, `from sklearn.family import Model`. Here, `.family` represents the family to which the specific algorithm belongs, and `Model` is the algorithm itself. So, for example we could type, `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression` to import the linear regression algorithm from the `linear_model` family of algorithms.\n",
    "- __Step 2__ Instantiate the model: When doing this we can set all the parameters of the estimator (or model). This will directly affect how the algorithm runs and we should remind ourselves that in Jupyter, we can use Shift+Tab to see all the possible parameters. For example, suppose we want to instantiate a linear regression model in which the coefficients are forced to be positive. In this case, we would pass the following: `model = LinearRegression(positive=True)`. Other parameters in this example include `fit_intercept` which determines whether or not to calculate the intercept for this model, `copy_X` which, as expected determines whether or not to overwrite X, and `n_jobs` which determines the number of jobs to use for the computation. For more information on this model, see\n",

    "    More information on all the algorithms Scikit Learn offers can be found here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\n",
    "- __Step 3a__ Fit the model onto some data. As will be discussed (perhaps it already has), we should split this data into a training set and a test set. Let's see an example of how to do this."

    "If we were to work out the MAE of III (say), then we note that the distance between each point and the regression line is, for the most part, quite small. However, there is one point (the topmost) which is substantially further away from the line than the others. While this will obviously affect the MAE, it will not faithfully reflect the error we are getting. In contrast, the MSE will. This is because we are squaring the distance and so, large distances make an even bigger impact as they are getting squared.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude on two final points. First, we note that evaluation metrics are not absolute measures of a model's suitability. In other words, there is no clear cut answer to the question, 'Is my accuracy (say) sufficient?'. This is because context matters. Suppose we are making predictions on the outcome of a sporting event and our model comes back with an 80% accuracy. In this case, 80% is probably reasonable. However, if we instead want to predict/diagnose whether a patient has a condition/disease then 80% is probably insufficient. After all, we wouldn't want to be one of those 20% who are told we are fine when in reality we have a medical condition! Of course, even this is not clear cut since some medical tests are not that accurate, or perhaps we care more about minimising false negatives than false positives (or vice versa). In any case, if we understand that there is this issue with accuracy then we can combine this hypothetical test with other tests. Moreover, there is still the question of balanced/unbalanced classes, which evaluation metric to use etc. We just used accuracy as an example, but the exact same issue exists for recall, precision, F1 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the same issues arise when considering regression problems. Suppose we are predicting a future price and this prediction is getting a RMSE of £20. If we were trying to predict house prices then this would be incredible, but if we are trying to predict the price of a pint of milk, less so. As ever, context and domain knowledge is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second note is on the different methods we can use with estimators. In supervised estimators, we can also use the `.predict_proba()` method (instead of `.predict()`). This returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label. The label with the highest probability is then returned by `model.predict()`. Another option is the `.score()` method which, for classification or regression problems, provides a score between 0 and 1 where a larger score indicates a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised estimators, we also have a `.predict()` method which predicts labels in clustering algorithms. Another option is the `.transform()` method which takes in one argument `X_new` and spits out a new representation of the data based on the unsupervised model. Finally is the `.fit_transform()` method which for some estimators provides a more efficient way to fit and transform the same input data."
